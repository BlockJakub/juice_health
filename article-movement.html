        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Exercise improves mood, reduces disease risk, and enhances quality of life. Even small amounts of movement
            make a difference.</p>

        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>Healthy movement includes structured exercise (strength, cardio) and daily activity such as walking,
            stretching, or taking stairs.</p>

        <blockquote>
            “Those who think they have no time for exercise will sooner or later have to find time for illness.” —
            Edward Stanley
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Advice</h2>
        <ul class="browser-default">
            <li>Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate activity per week.</li>
            <li>Incorporate strength training at least 2 days per week.</li>
            <li>Reduce sitting time — stand up and stretch every hour.</li>
            <li>Find activities you enjoy to stay consistent.</li>
        </ul>
